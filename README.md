_freeCodeCamp is a friendly open source community where you learn to code and help nonprofits.
We help our campers build job-worthy portfolios of real apps used by real people, while helping nonprofits.
You start by working through our self-paced, browser-based full stack JavaScript curriculum.
By working through our curriculum, you can earn four certifications:_ 

### _Data Visualization Certification_
